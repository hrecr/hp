  "summary": "Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Koç University (Istanbul), working on Secure Multi‑Party Computation (SMPC), privacy‑preserving machine learning, and post‑quantum cryptography. I like research that has both proofs and performance: designing protocols, writing simulation/UC security arguments, and benchmarking implementations (Rust/Go/Docker). Previously built automated crypto asset-management tools and market screeners, and worked on quantum kernels for neural networks using Qiskit/PyQuil. I’m also curating a Post‑Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Application Atlas (90+ papers across 19 domains).",
